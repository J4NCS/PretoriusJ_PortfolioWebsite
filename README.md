# PretoriusJ_PortfolioWebsite
This is my attempt at developing a dynamic portfolio website that serves as a virtual CV.
I want the he website to include sections such as About Me, Resume/CV, Projects, Skills, Contact Information, and any additional relevant sections.
I want to ensure the website is aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and showcases technical proficiency and creativity.
